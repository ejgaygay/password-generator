<h1><b>Usage:</b></h1>
Click on the .jar file - passwordgenerator.jar and download it.
Execute the passwordgenerator.jar via the command line or by double clicking the file.
Utilize the application and create random passwords of a certain length given a check of parameters.

<h1><b>Motivation:</b></h1>
In an attempt to learn about building GUI applications in Java, I have decided to develop this small little app that offers the ability of generating a random password with some characters and copying it to the clipboard for easy pasting. Made with Java, Java AWT, and Java Swing.

<h1><b>Future updates:</b></h1>
Some features I would like to implement are:

+Better designed UI

+Storage and password organizational capability

+User security and multiple user and password storing

+Different UI settings
